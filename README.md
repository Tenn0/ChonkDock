# ChonkDock
My WIP dock design for MadMax Toolchangers in a Voron 2.4
These are based on the F-Dock by @Ultameciia: https://github.com/Ultameciia/F-Dock



Hanging docks for a Voron 2.4 with the MadMax Toolchanger. No Crossbar infront of the frame requerired.  
They are chonky, an earlier version printed out of PLA was really stable, but were something like 100g PLA per dock and held only 1 Toolhead per assembly. 
Each assembly can hold 2 Toolheads

  
BOM: WIP, I need to figuere out proper screw lengths.   
     - 6 Voron spec M3 heatset inserts per dock assembly  
     - 6 6x3mm per dock assembly  


Print settings:
- 5 Walls
- 6 Tops/Bottoms
- 40% Infill (I use cubic)
- 4mm line width
- 2mm layer height, first layer 2.5mm
